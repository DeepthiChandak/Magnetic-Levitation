# Magnetic Levitation
Calculation of height of electromagnet coil from varying current and estimation of force on coil.
An electric field is generated by a current-carrying coil, and the force due to the magnetic field increases on increasing the current applied to the coil. An increase in force is indicated in this experiment by the height attained by the coil when subjected to the magnetic field of the other permanent magnets in the setup of the experiment.
Height attained by the coil = (distance of the ultrasonic sensor from the ground) â€“ (distance measured by the sensor when coil levitates) = h cm
